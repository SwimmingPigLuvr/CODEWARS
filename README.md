Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. 
If that value has more than one digit, 
continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. 
The input will be a non-negative integer

 
420 --> 4 + 2 + 0 = 6
911 --> 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 --> 2
 69 --> 6 + 9 = 15 --> 1 + 5 = 6
